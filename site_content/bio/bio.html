  <p>As you know, my name is Yuval, and as you might not know, I really really enjoy the art of coding. I <br>
    currently study computer engineering at York university, more specifically, at the Lassonde School of <br>
    Engineering. <br><br>I initially started doing math in school, and had gained the nickname of "human <br>
    calculator" in elementary school. My teachers thought I was smart, but there is no such thing as <br>
    being smart, I was simply more interested in math and numbers than other things. In the past few <br>
    years I've been obsessed with coding, and in the past century, I've been obsessed with improving my <br>
    environment, any way I can using my skills. I am particularly passionate about anything green; green <br>
    energy, green forests, green layouts for sublime and eclipse, you get the idea. My ambition in this <br>
    life is to make the world a greener place using my coding, business, and personal skills. I'm <br>
    interested in making devices for researchers to better understand wildlife, as well building anything <br>
    that will improve the current state of Earth's nature. I'm passionate and I like to get things done, <br>
    and that's exactly what I'm here to do.
